# Overview
This script explores global norms of alcohol consumption. I performed this analysis because I had no idea what alcohol consumption looked like globally, and I wanted to know. 

```{r global options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = 'figs/', fig.show = 'asis', dpi = 300, 
  include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, 
  warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache = FALSE
) 
```

```{r}
library(breadcrumbs)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)
source_file_paths()
```

```{r load data, include=FALSE}
drinks <- read_rds(file_consumption_latlong_ppp)
```

Poking around: 
```{r}
drinks %>% arrange(desc(total))

drinks %>% filter(str_detect(country, "R")) %>% arrange(desc(country))

drinks %>% filter(country == "Russian Federation")
```

```{r}
drinks %>% 
  mutate(
    lat_abs = abs(latitude),
    ns = ifelse(latitude > 0, "North",
      ifelse(latitude <= 0, "South", NA))
  ) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(ns)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat_abs, y = total, color = ns)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  scale_color_discrete("Hemisphere") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 80, by = 10)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Drinking spikes when you are farther than 30-degrees north from the equator,\nespecially so in the northern hemisphere.",
    x = "Absolute Value for Latitude",
    y = "Liters of alcohol consumed per person per year"
  )
```

```{r}
drinks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = latitude, y = total)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "green") + 
  scale_color_discrete("Hemisphere") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-45, 65, by = 5)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Drinking spikes when you are farther than 30-degrees north from the equator,\nespecially so in the northern hemisphere.",
    x = "Latitude",
    y = "Liters of alcohol consumed per person per year"
  )
```

```{r}
drinks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = latitude, y = total)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_width(latitude, 5))) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-65, 65, by = 5), limits = c(-65, 65)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "blue") + 
  labs(
    title = "Drinking spikes when you are farther than 30-degrees north of the equator,\nor 15 degrees south",
    x = "Latitude",
    y = "Liters of alcohol consumed per person per year"
  )
```

```{r}
drinks %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppp, y = total)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75) + 
  geom_smooth() 

drinks %>% 
  filter(ppp < 5e4) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ppp, y = total)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(
    title = "The poor drink less.",
    x = "GDP per Person (PPP) in USD",
    y = "Liters of alcohol consumed per person per year"
  ) 
```

```{r}
drinks %>% 
  mutate(
    ppp_f = ifelse(ppp <= 15000, "low",
      ifelse(ppp > 15000 & ppp < 30000, "medium",
      ifelse(ppp >= 30000, "high", NA)
    )),
    ppp_f = factor(ppp_f, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
  ) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(ppp_f)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = latitude, y = total, color = fct_rev(ppp_f))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .75) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "black") + 
  scale_color_discrete("PPP") + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-45, 65, by = 5)) + 
  labs(
    title = "Wealthy countries buck the trend of higher drinking in the far north.",
    x = "Latitude",
    y = "Liters of alcohol consumed per person per year"
  )
```

TBD: Add in religion as a variable. 

High PPP countries in northern latitudes driving the plunge in alcohol consumption:
```{r}
my_table <- 
  drinks %>% 
  mutate(
    ppp_f = ifelse(ppp <= 15000, "low",
      ifelse(ppp > 15000 & ppp < 30000, "medium",
      ifelse(ppp >= 30000, "high", NA)
    )),
    ppp_f = factor(ppp_f, levels = c("low", "medium", "high"))
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    complete.cases(ppp_f),
    ppp_f == "high",
    latitude > 50) %>% 
  select(country, total, latitude, ppp) %>% 
  arrange(-total) %>% 
  kable(format = "html") 

kable_styling(my_table)
```
